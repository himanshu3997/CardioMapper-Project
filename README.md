- Used leaflet library of JavaScript to create a project where we can add our cardio workouts like running and cycling pointing in the map.
- The user has to input values like type of cardio, distance, time, speed and point in the map where cardio has taken place.
- A marker will be added in the place where the cardio is taking place along with the date.
- It uses local storage to store the workout so that even after the browser is refreshed the registered workouts won't vanish.
